# To test it locally 
1) Build the docker container by running following command 
   docker build -t test .

2) Run the docker command, this will mount the output file in your local /tmp dir, you should be able to see the file passed in out_file variable from next commands.
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -e OPENAI_API_KEY="<your_openai_api_key"" -v /tmp/:/tmp/ test

3) Get the running container id and stream the log.
   docker ps  # get the container id 
   docker logs -f  <container id>

4) construct the curl command like below, notice tht `key` here does not matter since its not being used but container env variables are being used.
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
     "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301",
     "key": "xxxxx",
     "data_file": "data/adv-glue-plus-plus/data/alpaca.json",
     "out_file": "/tmp/alpaca.json"
   }' http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate/

5) you can stop the containers by running below command.
   docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
